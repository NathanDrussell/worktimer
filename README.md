# Worktimer

This is a small project I worked on so that I could run it on my Raspberry PI to facilitate tracking how much time I spend working at my desk.

The idea was inspired by a video on youtube suggesting that when you don't have multiple locations for different tasks (IE. An office for work, a bedroom for relaxation, etc..) and instead only have 1 location for everything (In my case, a bedroom), you should start turning on a Lamp while you work, and turning it off when you are done working. This kind of tricks your brain into staying focused for longer periods of time.
